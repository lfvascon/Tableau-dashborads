Each dashboard within this portfolio represents a unique exploration of datasets, employing various visualization techniques to communicate complex information in an accessible manner. From trend analyses to geographical mappings, the dashboards highlight my proficiency in leveraging Tableau's capabilities to uncover patterns, trends, and valuable business insights.
